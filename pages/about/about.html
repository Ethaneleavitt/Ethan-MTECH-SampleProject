        <h1>This page is about me and my hobbies</h1>
        <p>First, I love to ski! The feeling of flying down a mountain or perfectly hitting a jump is something that I've never been able to find anywhere else. 
          That combined with the serene surroundings of the snowy mountain creates an activity that is truly special. 

        </p>
         <p>I also play basketball for my school. 
          While we are a smaller school, I enjoy the enviornment that the team creates. It's also been a wonderful opportunity to get to know the lower classman and be a positive 
          mentor. 
        </p>

            Lastly, I am currently restoring a 1967 El Camino. It will be a beautiful car once it is completed. The current step is finishing getting the motor running smoothly,
            and then I get to build the interior. I'm very excited for it. 
        </p>
